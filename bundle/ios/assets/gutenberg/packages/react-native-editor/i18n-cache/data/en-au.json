This whole post is composed of <em>pieces of content</em>—somewhat similar to LEGO bricks—that you can move around and interact with. Move your cursor around and you&#8217;ll notice the different blocks light up with outlines and arrows. Press the arrows to reposition blocks quickly, without fearing about losing things in the process of copying and pasting."],"Of Mountains &amp; Printing Presses":["Of Mountains &amp; Printing Presses"],"Welcome to the Gutenberg Editor":["Welcome to the Gutenberg Editor"],"Learn more":["Learn more"],"Are you sure you want to unschedule this post?":["Are you sure you want to unschedule this post?"],"The title for the object.":["The title for the object."],"Unique identifier for the object.":["Unique identifier for the object."],"Untitled Reusable block":[],"Small":["Small"],"Reusable":["Reusable"],"Add to Reusable blocks":["Add to reusable blocks"],"Keep as HTML":["Keep as HTML"],"The response is not a valid JSON response.":["The response is not a valid JSON response."],"Editor publish":["Editor publish"],"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/gutenberg/":[],"Support":["Support"],"No comments to show.":["No comments to show."],"%1$s on %2$s":["%1$s on %2$s"],"Select Post":["Select Post"],"Select Week":["Select Week"],"Select Day":["Select Day"],"Select Month":["Select Month"],"Select Year":["Select Year"],"Archives":["Archives"],"Cyan bluish gray":["Cyan bluish grey"],"Vivid cyan blue":["Vivid cyan blue"],"Pale cyan blue":["Pale cyan blue"],"Vivid green cyan":["Vivid green cyan"],"Light green cyan":["Light green cyan"],"Luminous vivid amber":["Luminous vivid amber"],"Luminous vivid orange":["Luminous vivid orange"],"Vivid red":["Vivid red"],"Pale pink":["Pale pink"],"Inline image":["Inline image"],"Available block types":["Available block types"],"Transform to":["Transform to"],"Remove block":[],"Open publish panel":["Open publish panel"],"Large":["Large"],"Regular":["Regular"],"File":["File"],"Close dialog":["Close dialogue"],"Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons.":["Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons."],"Disable tips":["Disable tips"],"Got it":["Got it"],"See next tip":["See next tip"],"When you’re ready, submit your work for review, and an Editor will be able to approve it for you.":["When you’re ready, submit your work for review, and an Editor will be able to approve it for you."],"Are you ready to submit for review?":["Are you ready to submit for review?"],"Remove image":["Remove image"],"Invalid term ID.":["Invalid item ID."],"The ID for the parent of the object.":["The ID for the parent of the object."],"Error while uploading file %s to the media library.":["Error while uploading file %s to the media library."],"This file exceeds the maximum upload size for this site.":["This file exceeds the maximum upload size for this site."],"View the autosave":["View the autosave"],"There is an autosave of this post that is more recent than the version below.":["There is an autosave of this post that is more recent than the version below."],"Autosaving":["Autosaving"],"beta":["beta"],"Pin to toolbar":["Pin to toolbar"],"Unpin from toolbar":["Unpin from toolbar"],"No results found.":["No results found."],"Error loading block: %s":["Error loading block: %s"],"Unknown error":["Unknown error"],"term\u0004Remove %s":["Remove %s"],"%1$s (%2$s of %3$s)":["%1$s (%2$s of %3$s)"],"Remove item":["Remove item"],"Color code: %s":["Colour code: %s"],"Skip to the selected block":["Skip to the selected block"],"Schedule…":["Schedule…"],"OK":["OK"],"Block settings closed":["Block settings closed"],"Close plugin":["Close plugin"],"Editor settings":["Editor settings"],"Link settings":["Link settings"],"Unlink":["Unlink"],"Height":["Height"],"Width":["Width"],"Image dimensions":["Image dimensions"],"Media Library":["Media Library"],"Advanced":["Advanced"],"Add item":["Add item"],"Reset the template":["Reset the template"],"Keep it as is":["Keep it as is"],"The content of your post doesn’t match the template assigned to your post type.":["The content of your post doesn’t match the template assigned to your post type."],"Resetting the template may result in loss of content, do you want to continue?":["Resetting the template may result in loss of content, do you want to continue?"],"Document Statistics":["Document Statistics"],"is now scheduled.
